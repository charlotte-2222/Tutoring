Now that you've reached this point, you should know GitHub somewhat well.

Here is the next step:

# Youtube Video Downloader
Your goal is to create a program that can download videos from YouTube. Simple, right?

This one is going to be mostly hands-off, but you will need to know a few things - so here are a few
details:
- You can use any resources you wish, but you must use the YouTube API in some way either via a Python library or via the YouTube website.
- The program should be able to download a video from YouTube and save it to an MP4 file.
- The specific video you want to download should be specified by the user, either by URL or by ID, alternatively you can use a search term.

Bonus points for anything extra such as:
- Downloading the video in a different format (e.g. MP3)
- Downloading the video with a different name (e.g. "My Video" instead of "Video")
- Downloading the video to a different folder (e.g. "My Videos" instead of "Videos")
<br> and anything else you wish to add.
